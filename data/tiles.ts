We went to pick up the rental truck, got lost in downtown Kralendijk. This one is funny, because this is the smallest downtown I had ever been to. This downtown is just the waterfront or Boulevard, like itâ€™s called here, and the street behind it, that is all! And still, we managed to get lost trying to find the AirBnB. Lol.",
            "After contacting the host and exchanging pictures of our location, the host came and pick us up to take us to our \"home\" for the next six weeks. Cultural shock, here we go! After inspecting our new home, and checking out the bathroom, I was like,\" Wow! The bathroom is so nice!",
            "I looked around the rooms, and I could not find the toilet, I even went outside the apartment.It was hiding in plan site.As soon as the main door opened, there is a hallway, and another door, and there it was, the toilet room."]
